/**
 * This class represents an actual received "Glympse" or sent "Glympse".
 * 
 * The term "Ticket" is synonymous with the term "Glympse" when referring to the object that is created and 
 * sent to recipients in order to share your location.
 * A ticket contains recipients, start and end times (and thus duration), a message, and a destination.
 * A ticket can be received from another Glympse user, allowing us to watch that user.
 * A ticket can also be sent to recipients, allowing them to watch the local user.
 * 
 * Tickets are created by Users. When you receive a ticket from another user,
 * that ticket grants you access to view that user for a specific amount of time.
 * Tickets that are received can be watched by calling the IGlympse#viewTicket method.
 * Once the ticket has been verified by the Glympse server, you will begin watching the user that sent the ticket. 
 * If you are not already watching this user from a previous ticket, the Glympse system will create a new
 * IUser object in your IUserManager collection. The IUser object contains 
 * a list of tickets you are watching for this user. The ticket you are watching will be added to this list.
 * You can call the IUser#getTickets method for a list of all tickets you have received from
 * a given user.
 *
 * When sending a ticket to another user, you will first create a new ITicket and then call
 * IGlympse#sendTicket to send the ticket to the recipients you have chosen.
 * The sent ticket will be transfered to your IHistoryManager collection.
 * You can monitor this ticket collection and the list of recipients within each ticket for viewer activity.
